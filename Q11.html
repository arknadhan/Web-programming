<h1>tree data structure</h1>
<p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
It is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. 
The topmost node is called the root, and the nodes below it are called child nodes. 
Each node can have multiple child nodes, forming a recursive structure</p>
